# Yahoo-Finance-Tool
Downloads a csv of historic stock data for a particular stock from Yahoo! Finance

## How to use
* You need a JRE to execute this, I just do it through Eclipse
* Once you set up the project in Eclipse you need to change the stock symbol to the desired stock in one of the first few lines
* After that, if you're using a non-Windows computer you will have to change the download path in the main function
